Levels Beyond Coding Assignment

This project was build and tested using Windows 10, MyEclipse, and Postman using Java 8 and Maven 3.3.1.  It uses
Java 8 constructs so should only be executed and built using Java 8.

It was built with CXF and CXF's implementation of Spring Boot.  Once built, it will create an executable jar.

This application will create a web server at port 9080 due to a port 8080 conflict on my system.  If another port is desired, 
you should change the port in the src/main/resources/application.properties at server.port.

How to build
Please only use Java 8 to build and execute this application.

Execute mvn package org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-maven-plugin:1.4.2.RELEASE:repackage from the base directory.  This 
will build an executable jar in the target directory.

From the base directory either execute java -jar ./target/api.jar or cd to the target directory and execute java -jar ./api.jar.

The Web Services will be located at http://localhost:9080/api and the Front End will be located at http://localhost:9080/index.html.

Please let me know if you have any issues or questions.
